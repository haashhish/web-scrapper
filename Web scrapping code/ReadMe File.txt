Python files:
-------------
1- Part1.py: fetches the ad links starting from page 1 to page 85 while applying the filters required, saves link in "links.txt".
Part 1 contains so many comments as I was practicing the process of splitting, then I decided to split the whole process into 2 different ones. That is why part2.py is created.
2- Part2.py: fetches the details of each ad and saves the information in the following csv files: ad, car, carDescr, seller, and extraFeatures.
3- Part3.py: creates fake data to be inserted in the database for tables: user and done_sale after writing them to the csv files: fakeData and fakeSales
